If the reference repository is on the local machine,
automatically setup .git/objects/info/alternates to obtain objects from the reference repository.
Using an already existing repository as an alternate will require fewer objects to be copied from the repository
being cloned, reducing network and local storage costs. When using the --reference-if-able,
a non existing directory is skipped with a warning instead of aborting the clone.
